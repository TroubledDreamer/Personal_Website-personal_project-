          <h2><i> What is a Laptop?</i></h2>
          <br>
          <p>A laptop, laptop computer or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a screen
            and alphanumeric keyboard. Unlike desktops, laptops use a significantly reduced amount of energy due to
            their few/built-in parts like the monitor and the use of CPUs meant to maintain battery life. The toxins in
            laptops end up in landfills instead of the recycling centre. If these toxins end up in a landfill
            instead of a recycling centre they can contaminate groundwater, surface water or the soil.These harms show
            the need to take responsibility for the earth and stop these damages.</p>
          <br>

          <h2><i>Brief History and raw materials of laptops</i> </h2>
          <br>
          <p>As personal computers became more viable in 1971. A portable information manipulator was imagined by Alan
            Kay at the Xerox PARC research centre and designed in his paper as the ‚ÄòDynabook‚Äô in 1972. The first
            prototype
            was the AMD special computer APL Machine Portable (SCAMP).</p>

          <p> Many people think laptops produce hardly any harm. The truth is it is filled with harmful chemicals and
            heavy metals. Common chemicals found in laptops include:</p>

          <li> Lead</li>
          <li> Mercury</li>
          <li> Chromium</li>
          <li> Cadmium</li>
          <li> Brominated flame retardants</li>
          <li> Bromine</li>
          <br>
          <p>This list of chemicals is highly carcinogenic exposure can cause a number of serve health concerns such as
            organ failure and brain damage.
            Though these do not pose a direct risk to our health while on laptops. Instead, when they enter landfills
            instead of being recycled properly the screens, boards and metals that contain these hazardous chemicals are
            crushed and compacted, resulting in toxins leaking out‚Äîoftentimes into our soils and waters.

            Through being absorbed by plants these hazards enter the chain of both animals and humans causing.

            <p>When replacing our laptops it is very important to send your electronics to recycling facilities where
              they can be properly disassembled and reused.
              These are the National Solid Waste Authority Management Authority (NSWMA) offices in Kingston
